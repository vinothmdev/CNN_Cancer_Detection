The challenge is to classify histopathologic images into cancerous and non-cancerous categories using a CNN. The dataset consists of thousands of RGB images, each resized to 128x128 pixels, organized into training and test directories. This task involves image preprocessing, data augmentation, and model training using deep learning techniques.
